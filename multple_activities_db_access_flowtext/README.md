The objective of this implementation is to implement an application which incorporates android functions such as activities, fragments, 
intents, database, toast notifications and dialogs.A part of my long term application (CrowData) was implemented to accomplish the 
requirements listed in this lab. CrowData is a platform to crowd-source the datasets required for AI research and development. 
Researchers and organizations can post the requirements of dataset with their cloud URL, and individuals can contribute 
images and videos (onto the mentioned cloud URL) for the posted requirements.

Currently app is implemented with:
1. Login screen with hardcoded username and password
2. Home screen with flowtext view

Please note that this app is not anyway related to Stanford (or) any company. This was developed as a part of our course project for gaining 
knowledge on android programming concepts.
